## 🎥 YouTube Player Support

The WorldCam plugin supports playing YouTube streams with three fallback mechanisms to ensure smooth playback:

1. **Direct playback using yt\_dlp and eServiceReference**
   The plugin tries to play YouTube videos directly by extracting the stream URL with yt\_dlp.

This ensures maximum compatibility and reliability for YouTube streams.

# 📋 Local List Format for WorldCam

WorldCam supports loading a local list file containing webcam entries.  
Each line in the list must contain the **name** and the **stream URL** of the webcam,  
separated by one of the following delimiters:

* 🔹 `:::` (triple colon)  
* 🔹 `;;` (double semicolon)  
* 🔹 `###` (triple hash)  
* 🔹 `::` (double colon)  
* 🔹 `;` (semicolon)  

### 📝 Example lines:

```

Camera 1:::[http://example.com/stream1.m3u8](http://example.com/stream1.m3u8)
My Cam;;[http://example.com/stream2.m3u8](http://example.com/stream2.m3u8)
Another Cam###[http://example.com/stream3.m3u8](http://example.com/stream3.m3u8)

## 🎥 YouTube streams in Local List

YouTube URLs can be included directly in the local list as valid webcam entries.  
The plugin will automatically detect YouTube links and use its internal player fallback to stream them.

---

## 📂 Where to put the local list file?

Place your local list file (for example, named `worldcam_list.txt`) inside the following folder:

```
/usr/lib/enigma2/python/Plugins/Extensions/WorldCam/Playlist/
```

---

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Enigma2 STB (Dreambox, Vu+, Zgemma, etc.)  
- Active internet connection  
- Python ≥ 3.0
---

## 🧪 Debug & Log
Logs are saved at:  

```
